 Sencha is an avid supporter of open source software. Our open source license
 is the appropriate option if you are creating an open source application under
 a license compatible with the GNU GPL license v3. Although the GPLv3 has many
 terms, the most important is that you must provide the source code of your
 application to your users so they can be free to modify your application for
 their own needs.
 .
 If you would like to use the GPLv3 version of Ext JS with your non-GPLv3 open
 source project, the following FLOSS (Free, Libre and Open Source) exceptions
 are available: http://www.sencha.com/products/extjs/license/
